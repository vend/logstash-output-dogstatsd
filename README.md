# logstash-output-dogstatsd

> A fork of `logstash-output-statsd` upgraded to support dogstatsd on modern versions of Logstash (ie; 7.0+)

This plugin is a fork of Brigade's existing [logstash-output-dogstatsd](https://github.com/brigade/logstash-output-dogstatsd) which has been upgraded as it didn't appear to work with newer Logstash versions anymore.

**NOTE:** While we are using it to emit metrics to Datadog, it is not expected to be extended or maintained beyond what presently exists. You should not use it expecting any guarantees of support or quality.
